# Week 5: Let's chat

Last week you got your user database set up, methods to add and verify users, and created an administrative user with Admin powers.

Now it's time to put all that to work. You need an admin page to create, modify, and delete user accounts for your friends. Then you need a message board in your ***private*** members-only area where you and your friends can chat.

Admin Page:

Add user

List users

Edit/Delete user



Message page:

Add message

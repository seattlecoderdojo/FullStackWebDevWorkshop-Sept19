# Full Stack Web Dev Workshop-Sept19
An introduction for full stack web development: build a website and some microservices it can consume.



We will be developing our websites on Glitch.com. [Go to glitch.com now](https://glitch.com) and sign up for an account. They're free.

## [Week 1: An Introduction to HTML](week1/README.md)

We'll go through some basics of HTML, build a simple "About Me" web page to practice, and add a little JavaScript to it for fun.

If you already know the basics of JavaScript and just want to get to building back-end stuff, you can skip this week. We'll start working with Express next week.

## [Week 2: Membership Has Its Privileges](week2/README.md)

Now that we've made an "about me" page and learned some HTML, let's learn a little about Node.js and databases by creating a member database that lets our friends access a members-only section of the site.

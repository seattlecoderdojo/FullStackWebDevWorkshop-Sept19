# Full Stack Web Dev Workshop-Sept19
An introduction for full stack web development: build a website and some services it can consume.

We will be developing our websites on Glitch.com. [Go to glitch.com now](https://glitch.com) and sign up for an account. They're free.

## [Week 1: An Introduction to HTML](week1/README.md)

We'll go through some basics of HTML, build a simple "About Me" web page to practice, and add a little JavaScript to it for fun.

If you already know the basics of JavaScript and just want to get to building back-end stuff, you can skip this week. We'll start working with Express next week.

## [Week 2: Let's get dangerous](week2/README.md)

Now that we've made an "about me" page and learned some HTML, let's learn a little about Node.js and JavaScript so we can start building our members page.

## [Week 3: Membership has its privileges](week3/README.md)

Let's learn about sessions so we can keep track of information about the viewer of the page and how we can use that information to keep them out... or let them in.
